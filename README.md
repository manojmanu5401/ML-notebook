# Abstract and Introduction

There are eight notebooks here, and each notebook will address different types of problems based on different datasets. Although some datasets are not really reliable, it's worth trying and researching. For example, we approach this depression detection problem using the ensemble technique by combining all the best models trained in each notebook.

Tabular 5-class classification problem - 10 questions to classify the person is normal or having mild, moderate, severe or extremely severe depression.

### Steps including

1. Data analysis
2. Feature Engineering
3. Feature Selection
4. Data Preparation
5. Model Experiment
6. Model Evaluation
7. Model Export

### 6 types of models were being built

1. Naive Bayes (acc: 0.8722)
2. K Nearest Neighbour (acc: 0.8983)
3. Support Vector Machine (acc: 0.9576)
4. Decision Tree (acc: 0.8066)
5. Random Forest (acc: 0.9017)
6. Neural Network (acc: 0.9636)

The accuracy and time of each model were compared.
