class classification problem - 10 questions to classify the person is normal or having mild, moderate, severe or extremely severe depression.

### Steps including

1. Data analysis
2. Feature Engineering
3. Feature Selection
4. Data Preparation
5. Model Experiment
6. Model Evaluation
7. Model Export

### 6 types of models were being built

1. Naive Bayes (acc: 0.8722)
2. K Nearest Neighbour (acc: 0.8983)
3. Support Vector Machine (acc: 0.9576)
4. Decision Tree (acc: 0.8066)
5. Random Forest (acc: 0.9017)
6. Neural Network (acc: 0.9636)

The accuracy and time of each model were compared.
